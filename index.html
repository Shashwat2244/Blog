                           What is Uefa Champions League ?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL, or sometimes, UEFA CL) is an annual club association football competition
                            organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding
                            the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single
                            leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall,
                            behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football
                            tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league
                            champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

                           History Of Uefa Champions League
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly
                            known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's
                            domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in
                            1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98
                            season. It has since been expanded, and while most of Europe's national leagues can still only enter their champion,
                            the strongest leagues now provide up to four teams. Clubs that finish next-in-line in their national league,
                            having not qualified for the Champions League, are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and
                            since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Europa Conference League.

                          Format of Uefa Champions League
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                        In its present format, the Champions League begins in late June with a preliminary round, three qualifying rounds and a
                        play-off round, all played over two legs. The six surviving teams enter the group stage, joining 26 teams qualified in
                        advance. The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system. The
                        eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May
                        or early June. The winner of the Champions League qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super
                        Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.

                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The 2023–24 UEFA Champions League will be the 69th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by
                            UEFA, and the 32nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League.
                            
                            The final will be played at Wembley Stadium in London, England. The winner of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League will
                            automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League's league stage, and also earn the right to play against the
                            winner of the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup.
                            
                            This edition will be the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating at the group stage, after UEFA
                            announced that a new format would be introduced for the following edition.
                            
                            Manchester City are the defending champions, having won their first title in the previous edition.

                           My Prediction
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            In my opinion, it is still to early to predict who will win but considering past history and current forms of teams, we can give our own predictions for the next Champions League season. <strong>Real Madrid</strong> are a strong candidates to win the title this season. Signings of players like Jude Bellingham, Fran Garcia and rumours of Kylian Mbappe or Harry Kane coming as well, they will build up a solid squad for the next season. But, many teams will have stronger and more balanced squads perhaps what makes Real Madrid the favourites ? The fact that they have won this tournament 14 times even when they were least favourites shows that this team is a different beast in the Champions League.

                    <ul>
                        <li><h5>DESIGN FOR MANKIND</h5>
                            <p>A lifestyle blog by Erin Loechner, filled with beautifully-written essays on everything from design to parenting,
                            marriage, work, travel and more.I’ve never met Erin before in person, but she feels like such a kindred spirit. I have enjoyed tuning into her blog for
                            years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose. Her posts on navigating
                            motherhood and marriage have always been some of my favorites. But I have always especially connected with her posts on
                            slowing down, creativity, and self-care, probably because they’re always words I need to take to heart myself. I really
                            admire how open she has been to letting her career evolve and pivot in some big ways over the past decade, and I can’t
                            wait to follow along wherever the next roads may lead.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h5>A CUP OF JO</h5>
                        <p>A lifestyle blog by Joanna Goddard covering everything from style to food, design, travel, relationships and motherhood.This is another long-time read for me and one that I still completely look forward to tuning into daily. Her posts are
                        always interesting and fun, and I always look forward to her weekend list of links. Also of note — she has really
                        awesome readers, so the comment sections on her posts are always worth scrolling.</p></li>
                        <li><h5>ENJOY IT</h5>
                        <p>A lifestyle and DIY blog by Elise Blaha Cripe, full of tons of great inspiration for all things DIY (memory-keeping,
                        home decor, knitting, photography, recipes, gardening), great resources for blogging and entrepreneurship, and an honest
                        peek into daily life with her husband and two cute kiddos.I have been following Elise’s blog since before I even knew what a blog was. (Yeah, way back before blog readers, she
                        was a favorite “bookmark” in my browser!) And in that weird way that the internet brings people together, I kind of feel
                        like we’ve “grown up together” over this past decade. It’s been fun to watch her transition from life as a single
                        graphic designer to falling in love and getting married, having one daughter and then another, taking the leap from one
                        creative endeavor to another to another — and sharing stories and reflections and photos of it all on her blog along the
                        way. I just really dig the way she thinks about and appreciates life, and love her style. Now if only I could make
                        myself finish a scrapbook…</p></li>
                        <li><h5>ADVICE FROM A TWENTY SOMETHING</h5>
                        <p>A lifestyle blog by Amanda Holstein (who actually also writes now for The Everygirl), full of “advice for the modern
                        girl” on everything from fashion to beauty, decor, relationships, blogging and more.Don’t be turned away by the title if you’re not a 20-something. I recently discovered this blog, and have really been
                        enjoying it in my thirties. ;) She shares all sorts of helpful tutorials on all things stylish (from hair tutorials to
                        skincare/makeup tips to fashion advice and more). But then she also has some great blogging and career posts, as well as
                        her trademark relationship advice posts.</p></li>
                        <li><h5>THE EVERYGIRL</h5>
                        <p>A lifestyle blog for “career-driven women”, with a team of authors posting multiple times daily about topics from
                        career, to culture, fashion, beauty, travel, wellness, and more.I go back and forth between loving and liking this site, but lately I’m loving it, so it’s back on the list. ;) In a
                        nutshell, the Everygirl site shares a wealth of content for modern women about what it looks like to live a meaningful,
                        healthy and stylish life.</p></li>

                    <h3>THE TOP CHATGPT PLUGINS FOR DEVELOPERS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h5>ChatWithGit</h5><p>A relative newcomer on the ChatGPT store, ChatWithGit allows you to search GitHub with ChatGPT to find code that can
                        help you out. It provides a snippet of the code and a link to the actual repository. Needless to say, this is a big time
                        saver when you’re trying not to reinvent the wheel.
It reminds me of the classic joke between developers where one says to the other, "Hey, I stole your code." And the
second developer responds with a casual, "No worries, it's not my code anyway." Or in the case of GitHub, “Awesome,
thanks for the fork.”
</p></li>
                        <li><h5>Code Interpreter</h5><p>While this plugin is in closed alpha, it makes the list because it’s a very exciting addition to the plugin library.
                        This plugin makes it possible to run Python code within a chat with ChatGPT, with the option to upload and download
                        files, adjust the code, or have ChatGPT make changes and suggestions.
                        
                        People are already using it to collate big collections of data. One user uploaded a CSV of every lighthouse location in
                        the US and got it to create a gif of a map of all these locations, all with a single prompt. Ethan Mollick at
                        OneUsefulThing used it to create a bunch of programs that showed off its chops as a potential data analyst. In his
                        words, it’s “starting to get strange.”</p></li>
                        <li><h5>Zapier</h5>
                        <p>Surprise, surprise: Zapier, the king of integration tools, has a plugin for allowing you to integrate 5,000+ apps (like
                        Google Sheets, Gmail, and Slack) with ChatGPT. Prepare to spend a lot of tokens! Rather than switch consoles, you can
                        call Zapier directly within ChatGPT’s interface. It supports any of Zapier’s 50,000 actions (e.g. Search, update, write)
                        to any of Zapier’s supported apps.Now, while this is supremely cool on one hand in terms of automation, it’s also a little bit scary on the other. This
                        could give ChatGPT a lot of access to potentially sensitive data, data that can be leaked. For instance, ChatGPT
                        experienced a rather large data breach just this year, sharing the details of 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers,
                        including their prompts. If this was business sensitive data about your clients, what would be the consequences.</p></li>
                        <li><h5>Prompt Perfect</h5>
                        <p>Coming up with the perfect prompt for ChatGPT can be tough. In fact, entire courses on Prompt Engineering have sprung up
                        almost overnight. Prompt Perfect makes this easier by taking your prompt and rewording it in a way that gets you the
                        results you need. All you need to do is start any prompt with ‘perfect’ followed by your query, and Prompt Perfect will
                        do the rest.
                        
                        While Prompt Perfect is on the ChatGPT store, it can also be used for other large language models (LLMs) like GPT 4,
                        MidJourney, DALL-E 2, StableLM, and others. We found using Prompt Perfect made life a whole lot easier.</p></li>
                        <li><h5>Link Reader</h5><p>Link Reader makes it possible for ChatGPT to read all sorts of links like PDFs, PPTs, Word docs, and more. You can use
                        phrases like “Translate the contents from this link”, “summarize”, “interpret”, or “analyze” to get far more out of
                        examining a link than you could a search engine.
                        
                        We used it to go over one of our Multicloud reports, and were pleasantly surprised that it nailed most of the topics in
                        the PDF with a simple prompt.You can see behind the scenes that it’s reading the content directly, so it’s not interpreting it from page or link
                        context (as the GPT 3.5 version of ChatGPT likely would).</p></li>
                        <li><h5>Wolfram Alpha</h5><p>The Wolfram plugin helps patch up some of ChatGPT’s problems with math by giving the chatbot access to computation,
                        math, curated knowledge, and real-time data through Wolfram Alpha and the Wolfram language. </p></li>
                        <li><h5>Conclusion: Lots more to come in terms of ChatGPT plugins</h5>
                        <p>
                            ChatGPT is still frontier tech, and things are moving so fast it’s likely this list has become redundant in the time
                            it’s taken you to read it (Sorry!). In the interim, check out this short video for additional ways to use ChatGPT as a
                            developer, or the below resources.

                                    <h5>Defunct Streetlight Cameras Still Costing San Diego $1M Annually</h5>
                                    <p>San Diego officials are pushing for the installation of a new streetlight surveillance system, but the old one is still
                                    putting pressure on city coffers.
                                    
                                    The Independent Budget Analyst has concluded that San Diego will be paying $1 million in annual interest payments over
                                    the next decade. That comes out to roughly $2,740 a day from the Transportation Department budget for equipment that
                                    hasn’t technically been in operation for years.
                                    
                                    The original rollout was financed through a General Electric loan as part of a public-private partnership. The company
                                    offered $30.2 million in 2016 on the promise that infrastructure upgrades would pay for themselves through energy cost
                                    savings, but the city only drew down $19.9 million before the program went belly up in 2020 in response to community
                                    pushback.
                                    
                                    Of that $19.9 million, $11.8 million is directly attributed to the cameras, according to the IBA. The remainder of the
                                    money went to lighting and other non-camera equipment.
                                    
                                    The city did end up saving on its energy costs thanks to the upgrades, but it wasn’t enough to offset the overall cost
                                    of the project. Officials also ran into trouble after realizing that the technology wasn’t living up to expectations.
                                    About a third of the cameras installed on street poles didn’t work properly.
                                    
                                    The final payment is scheduled for July 2032. The GE loan isn’t the only financial cost of the first streetlights
                                    project, though.</p>

                                    <h5>India to have 40% of global workforce by 2050, but needs to skill it: Doval</h5>
                                    <p>National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval said on Saturday that India would not have been partitioned if Subhas Chandra
                                    Bose had been the leader at the time of the country's independence. British decided to leave India in a hurry because of
                                    what Bose had done and India would have been militarily better prepared for 1962's Sino-Indian War if the leadership
                                    shared Bose's commitment to building a strong army.
                                    Delivering the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Memorial Lecture organised by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry
                                    (Assocham), Doval bemoaned that history had been "unkind" to Bose.Doval's comments are likely to trigger a debate,
                                    especially his claim that former British prime minister Clement Attle
                                    told the acting governor of West Bengal in 1956 how Britain gave India its independence as it was scared that the spark
                                    Bose had lit could lead to an uprising, while Mahatma Gandhi was not as important an influence on the events at the
                                    time.
                                    NSA Doval said India's greatest strength is its human resource, which he said was committed to nationalism. He appealed
                                    to the gathering that they were in a "unique position" to skill them to make the country's workforce globally
                                    competitive. Doval said India's current workforce comprises 495 million, while China's is 850 million. He said, in 2050,
                                    India's workforce will be 1.1 billion, while China's will drop to 500 million. "We will contribute 40 per cent of the
                                    global workforce," the NSA said, pointing at how India's semi-skilled and unskilled workers in West Asia remit more
                                    money than the country's annual defence budget.</p>
